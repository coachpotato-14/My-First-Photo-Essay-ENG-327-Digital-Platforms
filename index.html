<h1>My First Photo Essay</h1>
<h5>My first time being a photographer was an experience to remeber.</h5>

<img src="(1) Copy Crossroads 1.jpg" width="550" height="450" alt="Crossroads"/>

<p>Photography wasn't very fonof me. Focused on the structure too much, unable to live within the moment that was there. It took me waking up at 5:45 am and taking a stroll down a below-30-degree trail for me to understand what a photo can say.</p>
<p>The goal I had set for my photos wasn't clearly defined in my head, but were within the lines of this:</p>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The crossroad, bridge, and bay all represent seperatly as milesonts that I've experienced. Collevctively, they represent teh path one must take to overcome hardships, the twists and turns in the trail.</p>
<p><strong>Mood/Feeling:</strong> Wanting to capture a specific mood is difficult, especially when factoring in specific wants for the photo. Being in nature does that and more, creating a calm and peaceful environment.</p>

  <div class="column">
    <img src="(2) Copy Bridge 1.JPG" width="250" height="175" alt="Bridge 1"/> 
    	</div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="(3). Copy Creek 1. JPG" width="250" height="175" alt="Creek Under the Bridge"/>
  </div>
</div>

<blockquote>
	<p><em> In my photos, I wanted to consider how the photos were naturally framed to creat an inviting atmosphere and help the viewer feel relaxed. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p> As part of the photo essay, these two images brought different perspectives to the bridge's symbolism and accentuated its meaning. </p> 

<p> I'm showing how the bridge interferes with the water's current and the bending flow of the water.</p> 

<h2><strong> . . . </strong></h2> 

<img src="(3.5) Trail 1.JPG" width="550" height="450" alt="Back On the Trail"/>

<p>This photo stands as a turning point to the collection of photos. The brush and trail move the viewer away from the bridge to a brighter, more serene landscape. </p>

<h2><strong> . . . </strong></h2>

<img src="(4) Bay 1.JPG" width="550" height="450" alt="Opening to the Bay"/>

<p> I chose to photograph the opening of the trail, leading to the bay, as the viewer finds the rest after the twists and turns of the path they've just walked. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="(5) Bay 2.JPG" width="250" height="175" alt="Bay 2"/> 
    	</div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="(6) Bay 3.JPG" width="250" height="175" alt="Bay 3"/>
  </div>
</div>

<p> My last pair of photos is the end of the journey after a rough ride; calm and peaceful scenery. </p> 

<p> It's an ending that we all strive for, <em>a breath of fresh air</em>. </p>

<h2> Reflection on Photo Essay </h2>

<p><strong>Allow:</strong> more people can view one's work through digital publishing, more outreach through the internet rather than through printed media, such as newspaper or written articles. Sharing media through the digital platforms allows individuals to view media from all kinds of people in numerous places around the world. </p> 
<p><strong>Inhibit:</strong> may mis-interpret the purpose or message of the art. When posted online, anyone can see everything and interpret the art in any specific way. For example, when taking these photos, I was with my friend. She hadn’t seen anything in one of my photos, (3.5). Until I explained what I saw in it, she then re-evaluated her perception and saw what I saw. If media is published and shared online, the meaning behind that media may become strewed. </p>
<p><strong>My Relationship:</strong> I don’t really have a strong relationship with digital media or platforms other than for my social life. I’ve posted pictures on my stories, but never really meant them for a purpose other than to post it. When thinking about it in terms if I become published, it changed. If others are able to view my work and possibly share or connect with my work, then the relationship would be reinforced. </p>
