<h1> I Guess I Never Had Patience!: Lesson Learned</h1>
  
<p>I've had many firsts in this class so far: markdown, HTML, and now website creation. I don't code, but learning the basics was fun; hope I remember them after this. The difference between the past assignments and this one was that when I typed something in, I pressed a button and it gave me a nice preview within seconds. This assignment, however, made me realize I do not, and have had ZERO PATIENCE!,</p>
<p>Inserting the files was the easiest part of the assignment; simple enough. I thought that was going to be it, but I was sorely mistaken. Nothing loaded! I didn't understand why it wasn't on the website. I'm an overthinker: Where's the image; Do the file names of images not match; Is it because I have HTML and markdown in the folder; WHAT'S HAPPENING??</p>
<p>I even roped my boyfriend into helping; he didn't get it either.</p>
<p>Getting on Teams with Kris was probably the most pathetic I felt because I felt like the problem was right in front of me. It was. He told me to click on the preview, I did, it appeared...WHAT?! I felt like a fool. He explained how the size of the document, commands, and other parts of the document affect the upload time. "It may take up to 15-30 minutes to upload a document of that size," Kris reassured, "that's why."</p>

<p>Now I know I need more patience. When it comes to coding, it's so meticulous and time-sensitive. So, if this reflection takes its sweet time to show itself on my website, I'll just step away a half-hour and check if it's live. If not, I know who to call.</p>

<p>P.S. Thank you Kris Purzycki</p>
