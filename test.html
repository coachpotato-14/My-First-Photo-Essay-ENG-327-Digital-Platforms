<p>I've had many firsts in this class so far: markdown, HTML, and now website creation. I don't code, but learning the basics was fun; hope I remember them after this. The difference between the past assignments and this one was that when I typed something in, I pressed a button and it gave me a nice preview within seconds. This assignment, however, made me realize I do not, and have had ZERO PATIENCE!,</p>
